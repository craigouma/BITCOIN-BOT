# BITCOIN-BOT
This code will continuously check the current mining statistics and the current price of bitcoin, and it will only trade signals that return profit. If the mining pool is not currently mining, it will start mining. If the mining pool is mining and the profit is above a threshold, it will place a buy order for 1 BTC and then a sell order for all BTC if the balance is greater than 0. If the balance is 0, it will stop mining. This process will repeat every hour.
The code you provided appears to be a collection of functions that allow you to interact with a cryptocurrency exchange's API. The functions allow you to:

send requests to the exchange API using the send_exchange_request function
check the balance of a specific cryptocurrency using the check_balance function
place a trade on the exchange using the place_trade function
check the status of a trade using the check_trade_status function
cancel a trade using the cancel_trade function
retrieve the current price of a cryptocurrency using the get_price function
It looks like the send_exchange_request function is the foundation of these other functions, as it is used to send requests to the exchange API and handle the API's response. This function takes three arguments:

method: The HTTP method to use for the request (e.g., "GET", "POST", "DELETE")
endpoint: The API endpoint to send the request to
params: A dictionary of parameters to include in the request (optional)
The function first sets up the API endpoint URL, headers, and payload for the request, and then calculates an HMAC-SHA256 signature for the request using the API secret. The signature is added to the headers, and then the request is sent using the requests library. The response is returned by the function.

The other functions in the code use the send_exchange_request function to send requests to the exchange API and handle the responses, using specific API endpoints and parameters for each action. For example, the check_balance function sends a GET request to the "/v1/account/balance" endpoint, passing in a currency parameter to specify which cryptocurrency to check the balance for. The place_trade function sends a POST request to the "/v1/order" endpoint, passing in parameters such as the symbol, side, type, and quantity of the trade.
